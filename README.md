# Hi, I'm Sunny☀️

## About Me

Once upon a time, a guy named Sunny decided to learn programming.  
Not because he wanted to become a tech wizard or make billions (though that wouldn’t hurt), but because he thought JavaScript sounded cool.  

Spoiler alert: it wasn’t. It lied.

Sunny thought learning JavaScript would be like assembling IKEA furniture — just follow the docs, and it’ll work.  
Turns out, it’s more like assembling IKEA furniture blindfolded, underwater, while someone shouts "undefined is not a function" every time you breathe.

Every day now, Sunny wakes up, grabs some tea, opens his editor, and dives into the jungle of curly braces and mysterious errors.  
He’s still not sure what recursion truly is, but he’s written enough recursive functions to scare himself.  
Variables disappear, functions argue with him, and bugs show up like uninvited guests to a birthday party.

He's not building apps right now.  
He’s surviving them.

And while most people scroll Instagram for fun, Sunny opens his console logs for adventure.  
Some call it pain. He calls it purpose.

Still, through all the errors, bugs, and unexpected side effects, he’s slowly learning — one `console.log()` at a time.
