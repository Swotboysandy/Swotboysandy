## 🧠 About Me

Every day I wake up and choose violence — against JavaScript bugs, mysterious database errors, and algorithms that act like they have a personal grudge against me.

I'm not a developer... I'm a survivor.  
Surviving async nightmares, SQL mood swings, and the emotional damage caused by that one missing bracket.  

Right now, I'm somewhere between understanding recursion and rewriting the same function for the third time — and honestly, I’m just eating or liking everything that comes in my way 🍕💻.

## ⚔️ The Journey So Far

Currently on a heroic quest to master JavaScript, wrestle with databases, and unlock the ancient scrolls of algorithms.

There’s no map. No guide. Just me, a keyboard, and a stubborn belief that I can fix this bug without Googling it again (I can’t).
